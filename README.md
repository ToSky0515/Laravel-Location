## Introduction ðŸ––
This Package offers a simple way to get Countries, Cities and States that you may need for your Application, most especially for dropdown menus.

### Step One - Installation

Require the package via composer into your project

```shell
composer require ichtrojan/laravel-location
```

![composer install](https://res.cloudinary.com/ichtrojan/image/upload/v1557601533/Screenshot_2019-05-11_at_8.04.49_PM_ojixaa.png)

### Step Two - Publishing Configurations
Laravel location provides you with an easy way of customizing the tables used for storing Countries, States and Cities. To customize this you need to publish the 
configuration file and edit the table names. To publish the configuration files, run:

`php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-location-config`

You will have `config/laravel-location.php` available for you to edit. Te default content of the configuration is like so:
```php
<?php
    return [
        'countries_table' => 'countries',
        'cities_table' => 'cities',
        'states_table' => 'states',
    ];
```
You can go ahead and customize the Table names as you need before running the Migration.

### Step Three - Publishing Seeds

Next, publish the Seeders from the package

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-location-seeds
```

or Run

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish
```

You will end up with a selection like this
